    "Blackjack environment is part of the Gymnasium's [Toy Text](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/) environments. Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by obtaining cards that sum to closer to 21 (without going over 21) than the dealer's cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game starts with the dealer having one face up and one face down card, while the player has two face up cards. All cards are drawn from an infinite deck (i.e. with replacement).\n",
    "\n",
    "The card values are, as depicted in the following figure:\n",
    "- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) have a point value of **10**.\n",
    "- Aces can either count as **11** (called a ``usable ace'') or **1**.\n",
    "- Numerical cards (**2-9**) have a value equal to their number.\n",

    "The player has the sum of cards held. The player can request additional cards (**hit**) until they decide to stop (**stick**) or exceed 21 (**bust**, immediate loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the player sticks, the dealer reveals their face down card, and draws cards until their sum is 17 or greater. If the dealer goes bust, the player wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the outcome (win, lose, draw) is decided by whose sum is closer to 21.\n",
